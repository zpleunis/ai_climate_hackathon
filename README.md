Goal: train a neural network to predict Canadian federal election results in Quebec based on weather station-derived climate variables.

There are scripts to parse climatedata.ca weather station data and open.canada.ca election results data. There is a Jupyter notebook that contains the neural network training and results and there is a Jupyter notebook to visualize election outcomes and climate variables (per riding).
